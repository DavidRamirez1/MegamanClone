# MegamanClone
Simple Megaman Clone with JS (Sprite Sheet Animation)

The purpose of this project is to showcase the use of sprite sheets to show interactive animations that simulates Megaman's movement and basic actions, such as jumping and shooting, as well as the scrolling of the stage sprites. The player can control Mega Man and utilize similar controls to the original game to manipulate him. Also, when Mega Man moves forward to the right, the level will scroll accordingly as the player moves forward, as well as stop scrolling when Mega Man stops moving right. This scroll activates when the player reaches the middle of the screen to simulate the original game. 

To use the program, simply run "megaman.html" on your browser of choice with the location you've chosen for the file. Make sure the assets of the program, such as the images and audio, are in the same location as "megaman.html" (I.E. In the same folder), otherwise it will not work correctly. After running it, you will go straight to the game and just refresh the page to reset the level if desired. 

Controls: 
• I: Jump • J: Move Left • L: Move right • Spacebar: Shoot Bullets
